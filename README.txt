Overview
========

This package provides an queryparser, querybuilder and extra helper tools,
to parse stored queries to actual results, used in new style collections.
It includes a registry reader which reads operators, values and criteria
from the Plone registry.

Compatibility with Plone versions
---------------------------------

The 1.1.x series is intended for usage with Plone 4.3 and up. It depends on
plone.batching, which ships with Plone 4.3 but may cause problems_ with Plone
4.2.

For use with Plone 4.2.x, use versions < 1.1.0.
