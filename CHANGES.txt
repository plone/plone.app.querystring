1.0.5 (2012-06-29)
------------------

- Date ranges now use the _betweenDates handler, which is much more forgiving
  of empty field values, defaulting to an all-encompassing date range if neither
  value is provided, an "everything after" range if only the start date is
  provided, and a min/max range if both are provided.

  [jcerjak]

* Limit number of items that show up in the preview of the edit view to 25.
  If we do not limit these results all items in the query will be rendered in
  the preview which leads to problems when the collection contains > 10k
  results.
